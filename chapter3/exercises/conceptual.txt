null hypothesis of coeffiecient estimates is that beta = 0, ie that feature has 
no relation with sales holding the other variables constant

TV and Radio have a non-zero linear relationship with sales, while there is no 
evidence that there is a relationship between sales and newspaper ads.

difference between KNN classifer and KNN regression:
* classifier outputs a qualitative response while regression outputs a quantitative response.
* classifier predicts posterior probability of being in a class
* regression uses neighbourhood to estimate f(x0) using average of training data.

a)

Suppose we have a data set with five predictors, X1=GPA, X2=IQ, X3=Gender 
(1 for Female and 0 for Male), X4=Interaction between GPA and IQ, and 
X5=Interaction between GPA and Gender. The response is starting salary 
after graduation (in thousands of dollars). Suppose we use least squares to fit 
the model, and get β0^=50, β1^=20, β2^=0.07, β3^=35, β4^=0.01, β5^=−10.

Which answer is correct, and why?
For a fixed value of IQ and GPA, males earn more on average than females.
For a fixed value of IQ and GPA, females earn more on average than males.
For a fixed value of IQ and GPA, males earn more on average than females 
  provided that the GPA is high enough.
For a fixed value of IQ and GPA, females earn more on average than males 
  provided that the GPA is high enough.

The least square line is given by
y=50 + 20*GPA + 0.07*IQ + 35*Gender + 0.01*GPA*IQ − 10*GPA*Gender


females:
y = 50 + 20*GPA + 0.07*IQ + 35 + 0.01*GPA*IQ − 10*GPA

y = 85 + 10*GPA + 0.07*IQ + 0.01*GPA*IQ

males:
y = 50 + 20*GPA + 0.07*IQ + 0.01*GPA*IQ

females earn more if 35 -10*GPA > 0

-35 > -10GPA

10GPA < 35

GPA < 3.5

females earn more if GPA is low

so,iii) For a fixed value of IQ and GPA, males earn more on average than females
provided that the GPA is high enough.


b)

female iq = 110, GPA = 4

y = 85 + 10*4 + 0.07*110 +0.01*110*4
y = 137.1k

c)

coefficient of X4 (GPA/IQ interaction) is small. This doesn't necessarily mean 
that there is little evidence of an interaction effect. We need to look at the 
summary table to see the t-statistic and the associated p-value.
